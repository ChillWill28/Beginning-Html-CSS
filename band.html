<b><h2 style="text-align: center">Best Three Albums</h2></b><br>
<dl>
	<dt><h3 style="text-align: center">Back Stabbers</h3></dt><br>
		<dd>Back Stabbers was the O'Jays breakthrough album.  Released in 1972, the album sold 500,000 copies and was certified gold.  The album included top hits such as "Back Stabbers" and "Love Train" and introduced a legendary group/songwriter collaboration with songwriters Kenneth Gamble & Leon Huff. </dd>
	<dt><h3 style="text-align: center">Survival</h3></dt><br>
		<dd>Once again the O'Jays with Gamble & Huff put their great talents to use to belt out another classic social conscious record. " Survival", "Give The People What They Want" and "Rich Get Richer" were all huge hits and the album rose to #1 on the <em>Billboard Soul Charts</em>. Of course they had to have those powerful slow jams. "Let Me Make Love To You" once again showcases Eddie LeVert's very powerful vocals.</dd>
	<dt><h3 style="text-align: center">Family Reunion</h3></dt><br>
		<dd>The Cleveland trio recorded one gem after another under Gamble & Huff's direction, and Family Reunion was no exception. Nothing on this LP has the bite of "Back Stabbers," "Don't Call Me Brother" or "Rich Get Richer," and the mood is upbeat and optimistic on everything from the uplifting "Unity" to the ballad "Stairway to Heaven" to the party anthem "Livin' for the Weekend." With "I Love Music," the O'Jays stressed the soul side of disco and provided one of the most appealing hits of the disco era. From start to finish, Family Reunion was a valuable addition to a catalog that already had its share of treasures.</dd>
